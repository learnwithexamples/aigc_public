## four workflows that convert text to different types of audio files:
1. text2aiff: output *.aiff file in the same directory
2. text2m4a: output *.m4a file in the same directory
3. text2m4amp3: output *.m4a and *.mp3 file in the same directory
4. text2mp3: output *.mp3 file in the same directory

## how to use
double click to install, then right click on any file, "Quick Action" --> the flow you just installed.

## where is the service installed?
/Users/yyw/Library/Services/

if you want to remove a service, simply delete it from here.
